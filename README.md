a synth using encoded waveforms and the wicki-hayden layout programmed in l√∂ve2d

### TODO:
- program support for...
	- a button matrix connected to a rpi3's GPIO
	- a character lcd ...
- simplify the wav file based instruments (use only 1+ pitch-shifted files, not one per note)
- FM support (far future likely)
- settings
	- more button arrangements
- looper(?)
and more to come, when i remember
